-> Continuing on the Gallery, add a functionality. 

On each of the image, when I click, show in a larger zoom popup. 

--> On clicking of any image, show in a popup format. --> That popup will have a close icon. (❌).

Clicking on this will close the popup. --> If you click outside the popup, then also the popup should close (This is mandatory to implement).
